# SBA3

The purpose of this SBA was to manipulate the Browser Object Model and validate forms.
By using javascript we are able to add alerts that will pop up depending on what you want the user to be notified of.
By manipulating the DOM we can also add inline styling similar to HTML.
With event listeners, we can add a dynamic event that happens upon doing certain actions within the webpage
